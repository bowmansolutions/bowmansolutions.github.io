<li>Software developers</li>
<li>IT professionals</li>
<li>Technology hobbyists of all types</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="history:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">History</h2>

<p>Bowman Solutions was formed in early 2007 when Jonathan freelanced as a computer technician for businesses and homes in the Harrisonburg, VA area. Since then, he has been a student, web developer, and is currently a pastor. We now reside in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Jonathan continues to learn, imagine, and invent. In his &ldquo;free time,&rdquo; he might be wrangling with a breadboard, a Linux distribution, a soldering iron, or a web application. He is available for consultation, idea-sharing, and troubleshooting.</p>
